    <h3 id="seismic">Seismic Waves</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 types of waves to look at</li>
      <ul>
        <li>P waves</li>
        <li>S waves</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Waves go <em>faster</em> in higher densities</li>
      <ul>
        <li>This means as waves go further down, they speed up</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Waves can be used to identify stuff underground</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Waves are generated and <em>reflect</em> off of layers differently into receivers</li>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reflect:</strong> when a wave impacts matter and changes direction at an equal but opposing angle</li>
          <li><strong>Refract:</strong> when a wave impacts matter and maintains direction, but changes angle</li>
          <img class="head-img" src="https://i.gyazo.com/fac59f2fb54bb131e721d2ec9948e630.png" alt="reflect vs refract">
        </ul>
        <li>On water, the wave receivers are called hydrophones</li>
        <li>On land, the wave receivers are called seismographs</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Seismic refraction refers to waves "bending" as they go further into the earth</li>
      <ul>
        <li>As mentioned earlier, waves speed up in higher densities. So as the wave speeds up, it gets refracted over and over</li>
        <li>This gives it its bending motion, and speeding up makes it bend up</li>
        he
        <li>We can tell where the division between the crust and the mantle is using this as well</li>
        <li>Using a seismograph, where the slope changes, that indicates where the division is (called Mohorovicic Discontinuity)</li>
        <img class="head-img" src="https://i.gyazo.com/f07260f8ecabb57c87f0b98d033691f3.png" alt="seismograph">
        <li>This is because of the different makeup of the crust and mantle. Waves move faster through the mantle</li>
      </ul>
      <li>P waves can go through all matter, while S waves can only travel through solids</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If we used seismographs all over the world and sent out tons of S waves, we could map out where there was no solid matter in the interior</li>
        <li>The S waves will travel normally through the solid part of the earth and be blocked by the interior liquid</li>
        <li>This allows us to map where the core is (since the outer part is liquid) using S waves</li>
        <img class="head-img" src="https://i.gyazo.com/92adb71f0a7fec508581ec4fcaddae67.png" alt="wave map">
        <li>Notice the P waves with a sharper bend, because they move faster</li>
        <li>Using P waves, you can tell the inner core is solid because they travel differently in solids</li>
        <li>You can also tell where the boundaries between layers are, as P waves also travel slightly differently through each layer</li>
        <li>Finally, you can also tell where plates are subducting because the plate is "colder" and so the P waves travel slower through the cold material</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="tectonics">Plate Tectonics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The main thing we're focusing on in this is the concept of <em>Paleomagnetism</em></li>
      <ul>
        <li>This is the study of remnant magnetism preserved in rocks to determine information about the earth's magnetic field</li>
        <li>First, lets explain how a magnetic field is generated</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Step 1: get a bunch of metallic material together. Preferably iron</li>
          <li>Step 2: run an electrical current <em>around</em> the metal stuff</li>
          <li>This causes the metal stuff to become a <em>dipole</em> (has a positive and negative end) and generates a magnetic field</li>
          <li>The field comes out at the south pole and returns to the north pole</li>
        </ul>
        <li>This part is important: Think of the magnetic field as a sheet of rays coming out of the core and then bends back into the core</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Now imagine a rock on the surface of the earth. The magnetic field can be imagined as coming through the rock as it travels on its journey to bend back into the core</li>
          <li>When a rock cools past a certain point (called its Curie Point) and it has lots of iron in it, it becomes <em>magnetised in the same angle as the magnetic "ray" coming through it</em></li>
          <li>This angle coincides with its latitudinal position on the earth</li>
          <ul>
            <li>So a rock magnetised at 30°N latitude is magnetised at an angle of 30°</li>
            <li>This angle is called the <strong>angle of inclination</strong></li>
            <li>This allows us to identify what latitude a rock was magnetised, but since there are north and south hemispheres we don't know which hemisphere just from the angle.</li>
            <li>Main thing to take away: rocks record their originating latitude and the location of the poles at the time they originated</li>
            <li>We know the direction of the north pole this way: if a rock has a 30° angle, the north pole is 60° away. If it has a 70° angle, it's 20° away and so on</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Polar Wandering</li>
        <ul>
          <li>If you record where the north pole was throughout time on different continents, you notice both that they don't line up and it changes througout time</li>
          <li>If you reassembile the continents though, the paths do line up</li>
          <li>This is evidence that the continents were moving, causing this phenomenon</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Magnetic Reversals</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Throughout time, the poles have switched (noth pole becomes south pole), called a <em>geomagnetic reversal</em></li>
          <img class="head-img" src="https://i.gyazo.com/457b8c6ecb5354d2dd7312d5d50655ee.png" alt="magnetic time scale">
          <li>This scale shows 9 geomagnetic reversals throughout time (count the lines between the boxes)</li>
          <li>This scale is easily shown in oceanic crust in the form of stripes of different magnetism</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>Now lets talk about how to find out how fast the plates have moved</li>
      <ul>
        <img class="head-img" src="https://i.gyazo.com/f6c1e6df5c7976454c9519c1c6bcefe5.png" alt="rock age map">
        <li>First, some terminology:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Isochrones - the black lines on the map. Signify 5 million years</li>
          <li>Velocity - the measure of distance traveled over time</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Since the time is the same between isochrones (5 MA), the further the <em>distance</em> between them, the faster the plate was moving</li>
        <li>The spots where the black lines are the furthest apart was where the plate was moving the fastest</li>
        <li>Using this, we can identify a few things here:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The fastest the plate was moving was at around 60 MA</li>
          <li>The plate began to speed up about 90-85 MA</li>
          <li>The plate slowed down about 45 MA (not coincidentally, this is the same time that India collides with the Eurasian Plate forming the Himalayas)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>We can also look at the direction of plates using hotspots</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Hotspots are still, while the plate is not</li>
          <li>Hawaii is formed by a hotspot, and since the older islands are to the south-east, we know the plate is moving north-west</li>
          <li>Try this: take a pencil and a piece of paper. The pencil represents the hotspot, the paper is the plate. Press the pencil into the paper and move the paper, keeping the pencil still.</li>
          <li>The mark that the pencil makes is the "track" of molten rock left behind by the hotspot. Use this if you get confused</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="flooding">Flooding and Rivers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Flooding occurs when there is more water than the channel can contain, the channel being a river/stream/lake/hole in the ground</li>
      <ul>
        <li>We're going to be looking at rivers here</li>
      </ul>
      <li>First some terminology</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Infiltration: the amount of water that goes into the ground. This is reduced with urbanization (more concrete and stuff)</li>
        <li>Runoff: the amount of water that doesn't go into the ground. This is what causes flooding</li>
        <img class="head-img" src="https://i.gyazo.com/d6c2171e6f20a1de19f69a6cd822fd7b.png" alt="runoff vs infiltration chart">
        <li>Drainage basin: the area drained by a river at a specific spot. (AKA watershed)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Imagine you have a bowl, and the bowl has a hole in the bottom. The drainage basin of the hole is the entire bowl</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Drainage divide: a seperator for drainage basins</li>
        <ul>
          <li>These are the edges of your bowl. So if you have multiple bowls lined up, the edges of the bowl are your drainage divides</li>
          <li>The Rocky Mountains make up the Continental Divide, which is a big ol' drainage divide</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Discharge: the rate of flow (how much water [in volume] goes past a point over an amount of time)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>This is what determines if an area floods or not</li>
          <li>If you have <em>high</em> discharge, the channel gets rid of the water before it can accumulate and flood (which is good)</li>
          <img class="head-img" src="https://i.gyazo.com/070127243ea239415c17903930843cf0.png" alt="discharge graphic">
        </ul>
        <li>Floodplain: The water level at a given stage of flooding</li>
      </ul>
      <img class="head-img" src="https://i.gyazo.com/7310d8984d808977002124f30e901e45.png" alt="hydrograph">
      <li>The above graphic is called a hydrograph, which plots discharge over time</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A stage is like a marker for discharge. At x stage, discharge is at least y amount.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>A few things to point out</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Discharge will rise rapidly, but it will fall slowly</li>
        <li>There is a lag in the discharge amount compared to rainfall because of the time it takes for water to accumulate</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Effects of urbanization</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Lag time is reduced</li>
        <li>Discharge amount is increased</li>
        <li>The rising limb, as a result of lag time being reduced, is much steeper</li>
        <li>Why: as mentioned before, there is less infiltration so more water is runoff (accumulates faster and in higher amounts)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Flood Frequency</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Recurrence Interval - average number of years between events of similar or greater magnitude</li>
        <ul>
          <li>A 100 year flood has a Recurrence Interval (RI) of 100</li>
          <li>A 25 year flood has a RI of 25, etc</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Exceedence Probability - the probability of a flood of a particular magnitude being equaled or exceeded in any given year</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Exceedence Probability (p) of a 100 year flood is 1/100, or 1%</li>
          <li>Exceedence Probability of a 25 year flood is 1/25, or 4%</li>
          <li>Meaning, in any year we have a 4% chance of a 25 year flood and a 1% chance of a 100 year flood</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>Reducing Flooding</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Now we need to put some concepts together</li>
        <li>To reduce flooding, we want to keep discharge the same, because discharge is what is getting rid of the water</li>
        <li>The cross-sectional area increases as flooding happens, because the water level rises. We want this to be as low as possible, because that will keep water levels low</li>
        <li>Recall that Discharge = (cross-sectional area)*(velocity)</li>
        <li>If we want to keep discharge the same and reduce cross-sectional area, we need to increase velocity</li>
        <li>We can do this in 3 ways:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Decrease flow resistance</li>
          <li>Increase channel efficiency</li>
          <li>Increase slope</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Manning's Equation</li>
        <ul>
          <img class="head-img" src="https://i.gyazo.com/f0b17895a6609dc64391c7c15df7d2fa.png" alt="mannings equation">
          <li>V = Average water velocity. Recall that velocity = distance/time</li>
          <li>n = Mannings Roughness Coefficient (a fancy number for how resistant to flow the channel is)</li>
          <li>R = Hydraulic Radius (another fancy number for how efficient the channel cross section is)</li>
          <li>S = Slope, appoximately the slope of the channel</li>
          <li>Key Observations</li>
          <ul>
            <li>n is in the denominator, so making the channel less rough will increase velocity</li>
            <ul>
              <li>This is done by basically adding concrete to the bottom to make it literally smooth</li>
            </ul>
            <li>R and S are in the numerator, so increasing them increases velocity</li>
            <li>Making the channel more efficient should intuitively make the channel flow faster</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Measured by area/wetted perimeter</li>
              <li>Wetted Perimeter: the part of the channel touching the water</li>
              <li>Basically, just make the channel deeper and you make this more efficient</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Similarly, making the channel steeper will make it go faster as well</li>
            <ul>
              <li>This is done by decreasing the sinuosity</li>
              <li>Sinuosity is a measure of how much the channel is meandering, or deviating from a straight line</li>
              <li>As we learned in geometry, the fastest way from point A to point B is a straight line, so the more a channel deviates from that the slower it goes</li>
              <li>This is measured by the (channel distance)/(linear distance)</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>Alluvial Streams</li>
      <ul>
        <li>2 Kinds</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Braided Stream: a network of streams that branch and reunite</li>
          <li>Meandering Stream: A stream having a pattern of meanders (bends, curves, loops or turns)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>We're going to focus on Meandering Streams</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Again, more terminology</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Cutbank: the portion of a stream that is being eroded by faster moving water</li>
            <li>Point bar: the portion of a stream that deposition (dropping of sediment) occurs due to slower moving water</li>
            <ul>
              <li>A meandering river will have a point bar directly opposite to its cutbank</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Lateral Migration: the process of a river migrating in the direction of its cutbank over time</li>
            <li>Meander Cutoff: when two points of a river migrate back together and their point bars cut off the old river path</li>
            <li>Oxbow Lake: the part of the river that is cut off in a meander cutoff</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Identifying these features on real examples</li>
